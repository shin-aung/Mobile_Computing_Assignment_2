**Self-Reflection:**

Throughout this 9-week journey, I gained a deep understanding of app development and honed my programming skills. The challenges faced, especially in game development, helped me develop problem-solving abilities. Integrating a utility app with educational games was a valuable experience, requiring me to consider both functionality and user experience. I've also learned the importance of testing and refining to create a polished end product. This journey has not only equipped me with technical skills but also improved my project management and self-discipline. Looking back, I'm proud of the apps I've created and excited about the possibilities for future projects.
